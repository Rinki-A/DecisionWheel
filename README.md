## **🔮 About Decision Wheel**  

**Decision Wheel** is a playful, witchy-themed yes/no decision-making app. Spin the enchanted wheel decorated with mystical icons — from **witch hats** and **cauldrons** to **crow skulls** and **flying brooms** — and watch as fate reveals your answer.  

With magical sound effects, smooth animations, and a confetti celebration at the end, Decision Wheel brings fun and charm to even the simplest choices.  

_Developed using [kodeWeave](https://github.com/michaelsboost/kodeWeave)._
